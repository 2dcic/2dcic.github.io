Limited funds are available to contribute to the basic travel expenses of UK-based research students attending the Colloquia. We ask for costs to be kept at a minimum, and for public transport to be used on all occasions and off-peak student rates wherever possible. Receipts for all journeys must be provided.

We are unable to confirm the maximum amount available at this point. Please contact <a href="mailto:{{ site.contacts.funding.email }}?subject={{ site.date | date: "%Y" }} Colloquia: {{ site.contacts.funding.subject }}">{{ site.contacts.funding.name }}</a> for further information.
