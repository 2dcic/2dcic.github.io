Some funds are available to contribute to the basic travel expenses of UK-based research students who attend the meetings. We ask you to keep costs to a minimum, using public transportation on all occasions and off-peak student travel tariffs wherever possible. Receipts for all journeys must be provided.

At this stage, we are unable to confirm the maximum amount available. Please contact ... for further information.
