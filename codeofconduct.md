Open exchange of ideas and freedom of thought and expression are central to research meetings. We expect cooperation from event participants to ensure a safe environment for everyone in all event venues, including ancillary events and unofficial social gatherings.

**Expected behaviour**
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
* Alert the event organisers if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code, even if they seem inconsequential.

**Unacceptable behaviour**
* Any action directed at an individual that (a) interferes substantially with that person's participation; or (b) causes that person to fear for their safety. This includes threats, intimidation, bullying, stalking, and other types of abuse.
* Any conduct that discriminates or denigrates an individual based on age, belief, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, race, religion, sexual identity, or any other characteristic protected by law.
* Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

Harassment can occur when there is no deliberate intention to offend. Be careful in the words that you choose. Unacceptable behaviour committed in a joking manner or disguised as a compliment still constitutes unacceptable behaviour.

**Contacts**

If you feel that you have experienced or witnessed an instance of unacceptable behaviour, you are encouraged to approach the following contacts for support and advice:
* the event organisers;
* QM Report + Support at https://reportandsupport.qmul.ac.uk/, where you can make a report anonymously;
* the QM S&E EDI Lead, Professor Claudia Garetto, at c.garetto@qmul.ac.uk.

**Consequences of unacceptable behaviour**

If an event participant engages in unacceptable behaviour, the event organisers reserve the right to take appropriate action to ensure the physical and emotional safety of all attendees. This can include exclusion from the event without warning or refund.
