We will host a poster session on 9th May 2024, allowing PhD students in Discrete Mathematics and related areas to present their work. A prize for the best poster will be awarded during the evening reception that day. The jury for this prize will be made up of speakers of the Colloquia.

PhD Students wishing to present a poster should apply by sending an email to ... by ..., with a title and abstract for their poster. Notifications for selected posters will be sent out by Monday 22nd April 2024. Posters should be A1 in size and in portrait format. They should be brought in at the start of the LSE day of the Colloquia (9th May 2024).

Some funds are available to contribute to the expenses of research students who wish to attend the meetings. Priority for this funding will be given to students presenting posters.
