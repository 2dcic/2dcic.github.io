---

A poster session will take place on {{ site.date | date: "%s" | plus: 86400 | date:"%-d %B %Y" }}, during which research students in discrete mathematics and related areas will be able to present their work. A jury of Colloquia speakers will select the best poster for a prize, and the prize will be awarded during the evening reception on the same day.

PhD Students should register their interest in presenting a poster by sending a title and abstract to <a href="mailto:{{ site.contacts.posters.email }}?subject={{ site.date | date: "%Y" }} Colloquia: {{ site.contacts.posters.subject }}">{{ site.contacts.posters.name }}</a>. Posters should have size A1 in portrait format and should be brought in at the start of the day of the poster session.

Limited funds are available to contribute to the expenses of research students attending the Colloquia. Priority for funding will be given to students presenting a poster.
