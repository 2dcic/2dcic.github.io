title: Simultaneous edge-colourings
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

The classical result of Vizing states that a graph $G$ be properly edge coloured using $\Delta(G) +1$ colours. We study a generalisation, where the goal is to simultaneously colour the edges of graphs $G_1, \dots, G_k$ with few colours. That is, we seek an edge-colouring on $G_1 \cup \dots \cup G_k$ that is proper for each individual $G_i$. When $k = 2$, we should that $( 1+o(1) ) \Delta$ colours suffice, where $\Delta(G_1), \Delta(G_2) \le \Delta$. This confirms asymptotically a conjecture of Agdur, Cambie, Heckel, Perarnau and Volec. For general $k$, we show that the asymptotical values is closely related to a conjecture of FÃ¼redi, Kahn, and Seymour from the 1990s and an old problem about fractional matchings.

This is joint work with Simona Boyadzhiyska, Richard Lang and Michael Molloy.
