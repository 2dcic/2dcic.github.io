title: Rigidity of Simplicial Manifolds
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

A *$d$-dimensional framework* is a pair $(G,p)$ where $G=(V,E)$ is a graph and $p:V\to {\mathbb R}^d$. The *length* of each edge of $(G,p)$ is the Euclidean distance between its endpoints. The framework  is *rigid* if every continuous motion of the vertices of $(G,p)$ which preserves the  edge lengths, preserves the  distances between all pairs of vertices. It is *globally rigid* if every realisation of $G$ in ${\mathbb R}^d$ which has the same edge lengths as $(G,p)$, has the  same distances between all pairs of vertices. A graph $G$ is *rigid*, respectively *globally rigid*, in ${\mathbb R}^d$ if every, or equivalently some, generic realisation of $G$ in ${\mathbb R}^d$ is rigid, respectively globally rigid.  Both properties have been characterised for graphs when $d=1,2$. Extending these characterizations to  ${\mathbb R}^d$ for $d\geq 3$ is an important open problem in discrete geometry.

Simplicial $(d-1)$-manifolds, i.e simplicial $(d-1)$-complexes whose underlying topological space is a manifold, provide a large family of graphs for which we can determine both rigidity and global rigidity
in ${\mathbb R}^d$. Indeed, the first theorem on the rigidity of frameworks 
is a celebrated result of Cauchy which implies that the 1-skeleton of every convex simplicial polyhedron is rigid in ${\mathbb R}^3$. This result was extended to convex $d$-polytopes in ${\mathbb R}^d$ for all $d\geq 3$ by Whiteley. Kallai used Whiteley's theorem to deduce that 1-skeleta of simplicial $(d-1)$-manifolds are generically rigid in ${\mathbb R}^{d}$ when $d\geq 4$. Fogelsanger introduced an ingenious new proof technique in his PhD thesis in 1988 to show that the same result holds for all $d\geq 3$.

I will give a brief introduction to combinatorial rigidity theory, emphasising results on triangulations of surfaces.  I will then  describe recent joint work on simplicial $(d-1)$-manifolds with  James Cruickshank and Shin-ichi Tanigawa in which we characterise when their 1-skeleta are globally rigidity in ${\mathbb R}^d$, and  also show that simplicial $(d-1)$-manifolds remain rigid if, instead of fixing the lengths of their edges,  we fix  the volume of their faces of dimension $k$ for any fixed $1\leq k\leq d-3$.
