title: Properly-coloured Hamilton cycles and the Bollobás-Erdős conjecture
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

What conditions on an edge colouring of the complete graph
with n vertices imply that it must contain an n-vertex cycle in which no
two touching edges have the same colour (i.e., a properly-coloured
Hamilton cycle)? In 1976, Bollobás and Erdős conjectured that if every
vertex is adjacent to fewer than $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ edges of the same colour, then
there is always a properly-colored Hamilton cycle. Bollobás and Erdős
gave an extremal example showing that the bound $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ would be tight,
and further extremal examples were later found by Fujita and Magnant,
and by Lo who also proved the conjecture asymptotically in 2016.

I will discuss further extremal examples and a proof that this
conjecture is true for large n. This is joint work with Aleksa
Milojević, Alexey Pokrovskiy, and Benny Sudakov.
