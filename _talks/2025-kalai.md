title: Voting Rules - Combinatorial and Probabilistic Aspects
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

In the early days of modern era democracy, Condorcet made several important mathematical discoveries regarding elections and the majority rule.  
Condorcet's jury theorem asserts that when the number of voters is large,even a small signal favoring a preferable choice leads, with high probability, to a socially optimal outcome. This result, derived from the weak law of large numbers, reflects the idea that the collective opinion of a diverse and independent group tends to yield good judgments. Condorcet's paradox states that when there are three or more candidates, the majority rule can lead to cyclic social preferences. Arrow later demonstrated that under very general conditions, Condorcet's paradox applies to every non-dictatorial voting rule.  

We will explore combinatorial and probabilistic aspects of voting rules. Specifically, for general monotone two-candidate voting rules, we will present a sharp connection between Condorcet's jury theorem and the maximal Shapley-Shubik power index of voters (joint work with Noam Lifshitz).   Additionally, we will discuss research by Eric Maskin and Gabriel Gendler on a relaxation of Arrow's Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) condition. If time permits, we will also touch on indeterminacy and noise sensitivity.
