title: Lattice reduced polytopes and the flatness question
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

We call a convex body lattice reduced if it does not strictly contain any other convex body of the same lattice width---a parameter studying "how flat" a convex body is with respect to the lattice of integer points.  We show structural properties of lattice reduced convex bodies: that they are polytopes, with not too many vertices; and then investigate the connection to the flatness problem: determining, for each dimension, the maximum lattice width of convex bodies without interior integer points. We will then delve into further directions of study and open questions.
