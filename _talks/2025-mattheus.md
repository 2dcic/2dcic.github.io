title: Improved bounds for the minimum degree of minimal Ramsey graphs
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

In 1976, Burr, Erdős and Lovász initiated a systematic study of various properties of Ramsey graphs. A graph $G$ is said to be $r$-Ramsey if every $r$-colouring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $K_k$. Moreover, it is called minimal when no proper subgraph of $G$ has this property. While historically a lot of attention has been devoted to the smallest possible order of a $2$-Ramsey graph, one could also consider for example the smallest chromatic number, maximum, or minimum degree of a minimal $r$-Ramsey graph.

While Burr, Erdős and Lovász already determined the smallest possible minimum degree of minimal $2$-Ramsey graphs, the behavior of this quantity is much less understood for more colours. In particular, it is not clear what the correct asymptotic behaviour (in both $k$ and $r$) is. We will present some progress towards this problem, based on joint work Jacques Verstraete.
