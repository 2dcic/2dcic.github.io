title: Single-Source Unsplittable Flows in Planar and Bounded Genus Graphs
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

The single-source unsplittable flow problem asks to send flow in a digraph with capacities from a common source to different terminals with unrelated demands, each terminal being served through a single path. A seminal result of Dinitz, Garg, and Goemans showed that, whenever a fractional flow exists respecting the capacities, then there is an unsplittable one violating the capacities by at most the maximum demand. Goemans conjectured a very natural cost version of the same result, where the unsplittable flow is required to be no more expensive than the fractional one. Moreover, Morell and Skutella conjecture a version with lower and upper bounds on the flow along every arc. 
In this talk we will see that the conjecture by Morell and Skutella as well as a slightly weaker version of the Goemans' conjecture hold on planar graphs. Moreover, we will observe that our approach can be extended to general (non-planar) graphs with a capacity violation that depends on the genus.
Based on joint work with Vera Traub and Rico Zenklusen.
